<p>Excel is the most revolutionary program of our time, you probably know Excel and it probably indirectly helps your business make a lot of money.</p>
<p>There are a other programs you don't know that will help your business make much more money, but we cannot use them for you, you must learn them.</p>
<p>If you want your company to use Excel, you must learn how to use Excel, it is a bad idea to pay a third company to use Excel for you. The Digital Transformation follows the same logic: if you want your company to use a new technology, you must learn how to use that technology, it is a bad idea to pay a third company to do it for you. </p>
<p>Digital Transformation combined with Digital Education</p>
