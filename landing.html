<h3>philosophy</h3>
<h4>we have 2 beliefs:</h4>
<ol>
	<li> Digital Transformation: digital solutions will increase your profits. </li>
	<li> Digital Education: online courses don't teach you anything, you will only learn by doing. </li>
</ol>
<h4>we have 1 conclusion:</h4>
<h5>You will learn by doing your own digital solutions (and we will give you a helping hand)</h5>
<ul>
	<li> we will show you the path to accomplishing your digital ideas. </li> 
	<li> we will help you navigate that path. </li> 
	<li> we will teach you the necessary technologies. </li> 
	<li> we will answer your questions. </li> 
	<li> we will show you new possible and already proven paths. </li>

<p>Excel is the most revolutionary program of our time, you probably know Excel and it probably indirectly helps your business make a lot of money.</p>
<p>There are a other programs you don't know that will help your business make much more money, but we cannot use them for you, you must learn them.</p>
<p>If you want your company to use Excel, you must learn how to use Excel, it is a bad idea to pay a third company to use Excel for you. The Digital Transformation follows the same logic: if you want your company to use a new technology, you must learn how to use that technology, it is a bad idea to pay a third company to do it for you. </p>
<p>Digital Transformation combined with Digital Education</p>
